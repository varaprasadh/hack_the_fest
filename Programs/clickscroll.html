	<br> Objectives:
To provide knowledge about the normalization techniques.
Learning Outcomes:
Students will be able to
 Understand various normalization techniques.
 Perform lossless decomposition and FD preserving on relations.
 To know how to overcome anomalies caused by redundancy.
 To know how to eliminate redundancy.
 Design the good database schema.
UNIT-III
Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases- Informal Design
guidelines for relation schemes, Functional dependencies, Normal forms-First, second and third
normal forms, Boyce- Cod normal form, Multi valued &Join Dependencies, 4th & 5th Normal
forms.

Database Design
Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases
Informal design guidelines for relation schemes
The four informal design guidelines for relation schemas are;
? Guideline 1: Semantics of the Attributes
? Guideline 2: Reducing the redundant values in tuples
? Guideline 3: Reducing the null values in tuples
? Guideline 4: Disallowing spurious tuples
Guideline 1: Semantics of the Attributes
? Design a relation schema so that it is easy to explain its meaning.
? Do not combine attributes from multiple entity types and relationships types into a single
relation.
? Institutively, if a relation schema corresponds to one entity type or one relationship type,
the meaning tends to be clear. Otherwise, it tends to be a mixture of multiple entities and
relationships and hence semantically unclear.
